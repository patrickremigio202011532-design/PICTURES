WHAT FORMA DOES (Clarity Section)
One Partner. Every Step.

Forma is your single point of contact for construction planning and execution.
We bridge the gap between design, contractors, and financing so your project moves faster, smoother, and with fewer surprises.

Whether you’re building an ADU, remodeling, or developing property, we handle the coordination — you stay informed and in control.

HOW IT WORKS (This is critical for conversion)
Step 1: Consultation & Feasibility

We evaluate your goals, budget, site constraints, and zoning to determine what’s realistically possible.

Step 2: Design & Planning

Our design team prepares plans, layouts, and documentation tailored to your project and jurisdiction.

Step 3: Contractor Matching

We connect you with vetted contractors who are a fit for your scope, timeline, and budget — not random bids.

Step 4: Build Support & Oversight

We stay involved through construction to ensure alignment between plans, contractors, and expectations.

Step 5: Financing (When Applicable)

We help explore financing pathways so projects don’t stall due to cash flow or upfront costs.
